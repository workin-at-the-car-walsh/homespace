# Pinned Post Test

This is a test post to demonstrate the pinned feature. This post should appear at the top of the blog regardless of its publication date.

## How the Pinned Feature Works

1. Add `pinned: true` to the frontmatter of a post
2. The post will be displayed at the top of the blog
3. Multiple pinned posts will be sorted by their publication date (newest first)
